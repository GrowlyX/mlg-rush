# MLG Rush
An old MLG rush plugin a friend & I wrote for bridger.land.
 - This was never used due to issues with the owner of the server.
 - This has not been tested in a production environment, and has quite a few bugs.

## Setup
- Enter your mongodb uri in the `config.yml` file.
- Go to the `scoreboard.yml` file and configure the scoreboard to your liking.
- You can now startup the server. 
- A new world will be generated with the name `mlg`, this will be your lobby world.
- To create a new arena, use `/arena create`, this will startup a conversation with you and ArenaBot.
- Congrats! You've setup MLG Rush!

## Dependencies
- MongoDB server
